# IR2Tab
IR2Tab is a tool for converting Intermediate Representation (IR) code into a tabular format, enabling seamless integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks like code analysis, optimization, and summarization. The project provides scripts for conversion and leveraging LLMs in downstream tasks.

# IR2Tab

## Overview
**IR2Tab** is a tool designed to convert Intermediate Representation (IR) code into a tabular format. This transformation allows for easier processing by Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform various downstream tasks such as code summarization, optimization, behavior prediction, and more. The project enables the representation of IR in a structured, machine-readable format that can be fed into LLMs for enhanced understanding and analysis of code.

## Features
- Convert IR into a table-based format for easier LLM integration.
- Support for multiple downstream tasks including code summarization, optimization, and error detection.
- Modular and extensible codebase, allowing researchers and developers to customize and extend functionalities.
- Example scripts and data formats to guide users on how to use the tool.
